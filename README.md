# Subst

![subst](./img/subst.png "subst")

__Currently under development and testing. I don't take any responsability for unexpected behavior. You know what you are doing :3__

A simple extension over kustomize, which allows further variable substitution and introduces simplified yet strong secrets management (for multi tenancy use-cases). Extends to functionality of kustomize for ArgoCD users.

# Functionality

The idea for subst is to act as complementary for kustomize. You can reference additional variables for your environment or from different kustomize paths, which are then accesible across your entire kustomize build. The kustomize you are referencing to is resolved (it's paths). In each of these paths you can create new substition files, which contain variables or secrets, which then can be used by your kustomization. The final output is your built kustomization with the substitutions made.

By default the all files are considered using this regex `(.*subst\.yaml|.*(ejson|vars))`. You can change the regex using:

```
subst render . --file-regex "custom-values\\.yaml"
```

## Getting Started

For `subst` to work you must already have a functional kustomize build. Even without any extra substitutions you can run:

```
subst render <path-to-kustomize>
```

Which will simply build the kustomize.

**Applications in Projects**

If an application is in a project, the value of `$ARGOCD_APP_NAME` looks like this: `<project-name>_<application-name>`. For example, if the application `my-app` is in the project `my-project`, the value of `$ARGOCD_APP_NAME` is `my-project_my-app`. 
All special characters within are converted to `-` (dash). For example, if the application `my-app` is in the project `my-project`, the value of `$ARGOCD_APP_NAME` is `my-project-my-app`. So the secret reference is then `my-project-my-app` in the secret namespace.

## Available Substitutions

You can display which substitutions are available for a kustomize build by running:

```
subst substitutions .
```

See available options with:

```
subst substitutions -h
```

### Paths

The priority is used from the kustomize declartion. First all the patch paths are read. Then the `resources` are added in given order. So if you want to overwrite something (highest resource), it should be the last entry in the `resources` The directory the kustomization is recursively resolved from has always highest priority. See Example:

**/test/build/kustomization.yaml**

```
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - operators/
  - ../addons/values/high-available
patches:
  - path: ../../apps/common/patches/argo-appproject.yaml
    target:
      kind: AppProject
  - path: ./patches/argo-app-settings.yaml
    target:
      kind: Application
```

Results in the following paths (order by precedence):

  1. /test/build/
  2. /test/build/../addons/values/high-available
  3. /test/build/operators/
  4. /test/build/patches
  5. /test/build/../../apps/common/patches

Note that directories do not resolve by recursion (eg. `/test/build/` only collects files and skips any subdirectories).

### Environment

for environment variables which come from an argo application (`^ARGOCD_ENV_`) we remove the `ARGOCD_ENV_` and they are then available in your substitutions without the `ARGOCD_ENV_` prefix. This way they have the same name you have given them on the application ([Read More](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/config-management-plugins/#using-environment-variables-in-your-plugin)). All the substions are available as flat key, so where needed you can use environment substitution.

###Â Substitution (Envsubst)

Subst does not support Environment Substitution. However we have a transformator, which allows to perform environment substitutions (outside of the subst context). [Read More](https://github.com/buttahtoast/transformers/tree/main/transformers/substitution)

## Spruce

[Spruce](https://github.com/geofffranks/spruce) is used to access the substition variables, it has more flexability than [envsubst](#environment-substitution). You can grab values from the available substitutions using [Spruce Operators](https://github.com/geofffranks/spruce/blob/main/doc/operators.md). Spurce is greate, because it's operators are valid YAML which allows to build the kustomize without any further hacking.

## Secrets

You can both encrypt files which are part of the kustomize build or which are used for substitution. Currently for secret decryption we support both [ejson](https://github.com/Shopify/ejson) and [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops). You can use any combination of these decryption providers together. The principal for all decryption provider is, that they should load the private keys while a substiution build is made instead of having a permanent keystore. This allows for secret tenancy (eg. one secret per argo application). 

Decryption can be disabled, in that case the files are just loaded, without their encryption properties (might be useful if you dont have access to the private keys to decrypt the secrets):

```
subst render . --skip-decrypt
```

Decryption can be enforced, if a secret can not be decrypted it's treated as an error (recommended):

```
subst render . --must-decrypt
```

### EJSON

[EJSON](https://github.com/Shopify/ejson) allows simple secrets management. I like it, because you can rencrypt secrets without having the private key, which is sometimes useful. 

You can encrypt entire files using EJSON. The file must be in json format (which is fun for kustomize). The entire file will be encrypted, which may not bes useful in all cases.


### SOPS

[SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) is commonly known and also used by [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/). 



### Kubernetes

For all decryptors you can create a kubernetes secret, which contains the private information for secret decryption.
